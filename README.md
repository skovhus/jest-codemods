Codemods that simplify migrating JavaScript test files from [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) and [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) to [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/). We expect to support migrating from other test frameworks in the future.

Codemods are small programs that help you automate changes to your codebase. Think of them as search and replace on steroids. They are executed by the [Facebook jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) tool.

This tool is made for trying out Jest on your existing test files. We strive to make the migration as smooth as possible, but some manual intervention and tweaks to your tests are to be expected.


## Install

```
$ npm install -g jest-codemods
```

This installs the runner as `jest-codemods`.


## Usage (CLI)

```
$ jest-codemods --help

	Codemods for migrating test files to Jest.

	Usage
	  $ jest-codemods <path> [options]

	path		Files or directory to transform. Can be a glob like src/**.test.js

	Only files using Tape or AVA will be converted.

	Options
	  --force, -f	Bypass Git safety checks and forcibly run codemods
	  --dry, -d		Dry run (no changes are made to files)
	  --parser		The parser to use for parsing your source files (babel | babylon | flow)  [babel]
```

To transform all test files in a directory run `jest-codemods test-folder` in your terminal.

Only files requiring or importing AVA or Tape will be transformed. Notice the console output for errors, manual intervention and tweaks are to be expected.


## Usage (jscodeshift)

To make the process as simple as possible, we recommend the `jest-codemods` CLI that wraps the `jscodeshift` executable. But you can also run the transformations directly using `jscodeshift`.

```
$ npm install -g jscodeshift
$ npm install jest-codemods
$ jscodeshift -t node_modules/jest-codemods/dist/transformers/tape.js test-folder
$ jscodeshift -t node_modules/jest-codemods/dist/transformers/ava.js test-folder
```
