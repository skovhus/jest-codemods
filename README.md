# jest-codemods

Codemods for [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) that simplify migrating to Jest. Currently we support migrating from [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) to Jest. But we hope to support for [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) and other test runners in the future.

Codemods are small programs that help you automate changes to your codebase. Think of them as search and replace on steroids. They are executed by the [Facebook jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) tool.


## Install

```
$ npm install --global jest-codemods
```

This installs a binary `jest-covemods`.


## Usage

Currently we support migrating from [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) to Jest.

```
$ jest-covemods --help

	Usage
	  $ jest-covemods <path> [options]

	path	Files or directory to transform. Can be a glob like src/**.test.js

	Options
	  --force, -f	Bypass Git safety checks and forcibly run codemods
	  --dry, -d		Dry run (no changes are made to files)
	  --parser		The parser to use for parsing your source files (babel | babylon | flow)  [babel]
```

To transform all test files in a directory run `jest-covemods mySrcFolder` in your terminal.

Only files requiring or importing Tape will be transformed. Notice the console output for errors, manual intervention might be required.
